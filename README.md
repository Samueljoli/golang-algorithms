# golang-algorithms

This repository contains many of the popular algorithms implemented in the [`go`](https://golang.org/) programming language. 

This effort was largely inspired by [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms). As the structure of this repository is largely influenced by the aforementioned repository, a round of applause 👏 and many thanks to [Oleksii Trekhleb](https://github.com/trekhleb), and the many [contributors](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/graphs/contributors) who lent a helping hand.
